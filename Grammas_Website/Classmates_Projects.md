Classmate Projects

##March 23 Sean Hauck

Sean is creating a shiny app similar to the FIFA player comparisons that you see. It seems like a very interesting and challenging project. He is currently finding player data to allow the user to make any combination of players possible. Since there are so many professional players in the world that seems like his most difficult problem at the moment. 

##March 28 Kyle
Kyle is working on a shiny app breaks down NFL player stats. He is currently working just with the Philadelphia Eagles receivers, but plans on expanding it to different positions and possibly teams. The data set is very large so he is running into some trouble with organizing it and keeping the relevant information. 

##March 30 Meyer
He is working on a shiny app to analyze a bunch of MLS soccer data. Right now he has the app set up to for the user to pick and conference and then a team and get a bunch of different tables and plots to analyze player stats. One thing I asked him was if he was going to update the data near the end of the project because the MLS season just started so many of the plots/data is stacked on top of each other. He said that would probably be his plan. He also had some interesting data on team value that he may or may not incorporate into his shiny app. 

##April 4th Hamblen
He is working on a shiny app about golfer statistics. The user can pick a torunament and get results on the last 7 winners and their final scores. He said that one issue he is having is for players who have multiple wins at the same tournament within this span. HE was working on creating a new variable for that. Additionally, he mentioned that the data was from a fantasy golf app, so there was a lot of unwanted junk that he has been slowly getting rid of. 

##April 6th Tom
Tom is working on an R package for covid around the world. It is a super cool project that allows people to do their own research about covid through his program. It was great to talk to him because I noticed that in his interactive map his labels were vertical. That has been something that I have been trying to do with my map but have not been able to find. Pretty impressive project from Tom though. 

##April 18th Zetterquist
Emile is making a shiny app for a bunch of NHL hockey data. Overall the app looks really good but he just needs to clean things up. One of the things that he wants to do is limit some of the variables that are in one of his plots. Right now there are 156 variables and he thinks that a lot of them are not really applicable for his project. Additionally, he wants to make his interactive line graph show up in the teams color when the user hovers over it. 

##April 25th Claire
Claire is working on a shiny app project about trade deadline odds for NHL hockey teams after the trade deadline for the past 5 seasons. The graph of the project allows the user to have an interactive map of the games prior to the deadline that allows you to see the opponent and the odds for the money line of the game. Additionally, she has a table that shows the top performers for odds after the trade deadline. 

##April 27th Jack
Jack is working of a Liberty League baseball shiny app. Currently, he is working on putting in some advanced statistics into the shiny app. Also, he has two different shiny apps that he has created. He plans on combining those apps as one of his final tasks.
