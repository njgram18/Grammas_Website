Found data online about Boston real estate home prices. Started to sort through the data and research real estate formulas to add into the data set. Starting to create new variables that will allow users to evaluate real estate and find out if it is a good or bad investment/deal. 

##March 28 Beginning of Class
Worked on creating an interactive map to allow users to see each porperty. I am trying to add markers to the map that allows users to get general statistics on each house like price, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms etc. Additionally, I found average NOI of houses in the boston area from a Umass real estate blog. With that I created a new variable in the data set called cap rate, which is a common stat for real estate investors to look at. I think I will use this cap rate primarily on the multifamily homes in this data set. 

##March 28 End of Class
I continued to work on the interactive map for properties in Boston. I added labels so that you can hover over the property and get its address, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, living space, etc. Working on trying to get the labels to display vertically and not horizontally. 

##March 30 Beginning of Class
I did some more research on the statistics and formulas that many real estate investors look at when purchasing a property. I filtered the data set to just multifamily homes and began working on interactive plots to allow investors to not only analyze the data but identify properties based on their address. 

##March 30 End of Class
I continued to work on the Multi-Family Analysis section of my project. I fixed a few of the errors I made from my work outside of class in creating the statistics, although I may need to take another look at that. I created a couple more interactive plots that allows a user to look analyze the table and identify an address of a property. Finally, I created a couple of tables as well that allows users to look at a plot and a table. I am beginning to create a table that will allow me to show the variablity of all these stats for Boston properties. 

##April 4 Beginning of Class
I moved on to an analysis of Condo properties for sale in Boston. I completed that analysis and then went on to researching how to change some of the aspects of the interactive map that I made at the start of this project. I have to apply some of the things I found and do a more general analysis of Boston real estate and show some of the variablity in the data. 

##April 4 End of Class
I worked on the condo analysis and the single family analysis for my project. Additionally, I started to work on the general analysis of Boston. I will show the varied prices for property types and will use this analysis to compare the overall Boston real estate market with other major cities across the country. 

##April 6 Beginning of Class
I continued to work on general Boston housing data set. I created plots that showed the variability of home prices in the city based on the property type. I did run into some issues that took some time to fix, but I managed to figure them all out. I then began searching for new data sets for New York. To be honest I thought these would be easier to find but it is turning out to be a little more difficult to find data sets with good variables. 

##April 6 End of Class
I finished up the Boston general analysis. I found a nyc data set on Kaggle for the NYC portion of my project. I looked through the data and tried to figure out the best way to simplify the data set so that I could use it for more analysis. I ended up deciding to rename the variable I need and put all the different building classifications that NYC has into more broad categories. 

##April 11 Before Class
I have been working on getting the NYC data set into a form where I can actually work with it. I went through the entire data set and figured out the each type of "Building Class Type" and tried to simplify it do allow me to do a property type analysis for each property. I struggled to get the code to work because the columns are not made correctly for because there are spaces in the titles. I looked for some different data sets in NYC but have not been able to find one with the right variables. I am going to keep looking or see if I can make this one work. 

##April 13 Before Class 
I ended up finding a better data set on NYC. It is set up much better for the analysis that I am trying to perform in this project. I continued to research for more data on rental prices in NYC for the rental aspect of this project. It was pretty difficult to find a general average for the city because it is so big. Most of the research out there breaks up these prices by neighborhoods. I was able to find one on all the average prices for each neighborhood and get the average rent per square foot. 

##April 18 Before Class
I began working on the analysis in the New York Data set. I decided that I would not be able to separate the data set into property types because there are just way to many different kinds of properties in the NYC building code. Therefore, I have decided to split them up by boroughs. Through my research there seems to be quite a bit of variation when it comes to housing in these different boroughs so I think that it should work well. I started with the Bronx but plan on going through each of the 5 of them. 

##April 18 End of Class
I got into the analysis of NYC properties. I was able to complete the Bronx, Manhattan, and Brooklyn analysis. Also, I added a new variable to both the Boston analysis and the NYC analysis. Its called down_return and takes the down payment and the projected rental income for the year to allow investors to understand how much of their own money (assuming they are going to get a mortgage) they will receive back due to the rental income the property brings in. 

##April 25 Before Class
I completed the analysis of the Queens and Staten Island boroughs and started the general analysis for New York City. Additionally, I started to look into some other data sets for more analysis and started to do some research on blogdown to get an idea of how to finalize the project. 

##April 25 End of Class
I started to try and get blogdown up and running to finalize my project. Unfortunately, there are still some bumps in the road with that part, but I am not too worried about it. I completed the NYC general analysis and it is now time to finalize the project. I plan to edit a few things and bring some other aspects of the class into my graphs and other features. 

##April 27 Before Class
I completed the content in my project and then started exploring blogdown and some of its features. I tried connecting my blogdown to my github repository but I am still running into some issues with that. Additionally, my project uses a lot of interactive graphs and maps to allow users to see the address of the properties in the graphs and I read that these blogdown websites are typically static, so I looked into how I can get my interactive graphs/maps into the website.

##April 27th End of Class 
I got blogdown up and running and I am currently tyring to get all of my files organized to allow me to start posting and setting up the website. So far, I have just been tyring to trouble shoot and learn blogdown, but I think that I am figuring it out and should have it up and running shortly.
